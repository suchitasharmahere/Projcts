This is a Power BI Attrition Evaluation Project.
The interactive dashboard is created to assist the hiring team in understanding and analyzing the organization's attrition rate. 
It presents Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that underline the reasons behind attrition. 
By doing so, it provides decision-makers with quick insights into the key areas, departments and gender demographics contributing to attrition within the organization.
